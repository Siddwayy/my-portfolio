                <p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1 | <strong>Game Title:</strong> Pit2 (Working Title) | <strong>Genre:</strong> 2D, Team-Based, Multiplayer Arcade Sport | <strong>Target Audience:</strong> Casual to mid-core players | <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
                
                <h3>1. Game Overview</h3>
                <h4>1.1. High Concept</h4>
                <p>Pit2 is a modern, 2D multiplayer adaptation of the traditional Indian sport, Lagori (also known as Pitthu or Seven Stones). Two teams of three players, "Hitters" and "Seekers," compete in a strategic contest of accuracy, speed, and teamwork. It’s a game of throwing, dodging, and rebuilding under pressure.</p>
                
                <h4>1.2. Core Gameplay Loop</h4>
                <p>The game is played in rounds. One team is the Attacking Team (Hitters) and the other is the Defending Team (Seekers).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Hit:</strong> An Attacker throws a ball at a central stack of seven stones, using a Quick Time Event (QTE) mechanic to determine the throw's power and accuracy.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Scatter:</strong> The stones fly across the map. The Defending Team must now retrieve them one by one.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Hunt:</strong> The Attacker retrieves the ball and attempts to hit the Defending players to eliminate them from the round.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Rebuild:</strong> The Defenders must bring the stones back to the central point and re-stack them, using a precision-based QTE for each placement. A failed QTE causes the currently built portion of the stack to collapse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Round End:</strong> The round concludes when the Defenders successfully rebuild the stack, all Defenders are eliminated, or the time expires.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1.3. Unique Selling Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Digitized Tradition:</strong> A fresh take on a beloved, classic outdoor game.</li>
                    <li><strong>Skill-Based QTEs:</strong> Success is driven by player skill and timing, not just luck.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intense Team Dynamics:</strong> Constant communication and strategy are required for both attacking and defending roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast-Paced Rounds:</strong> Quick, engaging matches that are perfect for both short and long play sessions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep Customization:</strong> Players can personalize their characters and equipment.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Game Mechanics</h3>
                <h4>2.1. Player Roles & Teams</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The game is exclusively 3v3.</li>
                    <li>Matches consist of 6 rounds.</li>
                    <li>Teams switch roles after 3 rounds. (e.g., Team A attacks for rounds 1-3, defends for rounds 4-6).</li>
                    <li>On the Attacking team, the role of the primary "Hitter" rotates, giving each player one chance to initiate a round.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2.2. The Attacking Phase (Hitter)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Hit QTE:</strong> A power/accuracy bar appears. The player must press a button to stop a moving cursor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfect Hit (Center):</strong> All 7 stones scatter far across the map. Maximum points awarded. The ball moves with higher velocity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good Hit (Near Center):</strong> 4-6 stones are knocked down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor Hit (Edges):</strong> 1-3 stones are knocked down and don't travel far.</li>
                    <li><strong>Miss:</strong> Each attacker gets two chances to hit the stack. If the first throw misses, they get an immediate second attempt. If the second throw also misses, the turn passes to the next attacker on the team. If all three attackers exhaust their chances (6 total misses for the team), the round is forfeited, and the defending team wins the round by default.</li>
                    <li><strong>Elimination:</strong> After the initial hit, the Hitter is free to move, pick up the ball, and throw it at the Defenders. A successful hit eliminates that Defender for the rest of the round.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>2.3. The Defending Phase (Seeker)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stone Collection:</strong> Defenders must run to the scattered stones to pick them up. A player can only carry one stone at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Stack QTE:</strong> Upon returning to the central stacking point with a stone, a precision QTE appears. This is a smaller, more difficult bar than the hitting QTE.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success:</strong> The stone is placed correctly on the stack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure:</strong> The player drops their stone, and the entire stack they have rebuilt so far collapses, scattering those specific stones nearby. This creates a high-risk, high-reward scenario, especially when placing the final stones.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Detailed Screen & UI Flow</h3>
