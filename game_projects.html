                    <p class="project-description">A turn-based dice strategy game built in Java Swing, where players compete on a 7x7 grid over 10 rounds. Each player rolls up to three times per turn, aiming to match dice patterns like "three pairs" or "sum over 30" to place stones and score points. The game includes AI opponents, dynamic highlighting of valid moves, and a save/load system using Java serialization. Core gameplay logic is handled through a modular design following GRASP principles, ensuring clean architecture and responsive UI performance.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">TowerEcho is a fast-paced 2D tower defense shooter developed in Godot Engine using GDScript. Players take control of a mouse-aimed turret to defend their base against randomized enemy waves, each with unique pathing, attacks, and escalating difficulty. Designed for quick reflexes and strategic play, every session blends precision aiming, timing, and resource management into a tightly balanced arcade experience.</p>
                    <p class="project-description">The game features real-time combat feedback, including dynamic hit effects, screen shake, and stylized destruction particles. Players can pause, save, and seamlessly resume their progress mid-wave — with tower health, score, and enemy states restored exactly where they left off.</p>

                        <li>Implemented AI pathfinding and attack behavior, including enemy projectiles, collision detection, and on-death effects.</li>
                        <li>Built a Save & Resume System to serialize and reload tower health, score, enemy positions, and audio state.</li>
                        <li>Created interactive menus and HUD, including animated transitions, toggleable sound controls, and in-game overlays.</li>
                        <li>Added audio-visual polish — particle effects, screen shake, floating damage text, and synchronized SFX for immersive combat.</li>
                        <li>Optimized game performance and code structure for scalability across future levels and enemy types.</li>
